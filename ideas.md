### Name of the game
_The game should have a name! "Skog", is working title. Or maybe uncapitalized "skog", to capture the informal aspect of walking in the woods, and interacting with nature._

### Logo for the game
The game should have a logo. Maybe a tree, or several trees because the name is "Skog"?

### Freediving
Being able to freedive. The character could become better over time (hold breath longer), but the stats should be hidden for the player. The character could show some contractions when 1/3 of the time is left. Maybe also implement that the character should breathing twice as long as diving.
Could also be cool to implement spear fishing and collecting crabs and shells.

### Bear
Implement bear in game. The bear should be able to walk, run, and attack. It could maybe spawn at random intervals. The probability should increase if food is left outside. Should you be able to scare the bear away? Maybe charging the bear could give a chance of the bear fleeing the area.


### Fishing
Being able to fish. It could be funne to be able to fly fish, with overcomplicated and accurate controls.

### Harvesting
It should be possible to harvest edible, and poisenous, plants and mushrooms. To make it easier to distinguish, a zoomed in view of the items could be possible to see when harvesting. If eating "Spiss giftsl√∏rsopp", for instance, it should take a good amount of time before the character notices. Maybe it even heals first.


### Traps
The charactar could set up traps to capture various animals, including the character itself.
